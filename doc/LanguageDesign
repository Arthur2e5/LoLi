Language Design of LoLi

LoLi is a Lisp dialect that combines Lisp - 1 and Lisp - 2, that means in LoLi there will be one namespace but supporting duplicated name, and the interpreter will infer the value based on the comtext (or by manully specified).

Here is the language design of LoLi:
-Basic Symbols:
	T			same as T in Common Lisp
	NIL			same as NIL in Common Lisp
	set!			same as SET! in Scheme
	def			like define in Scheme or defvar in Common Lisp ( (defvar foo #'(lambda ...)) while defining a lambda expression)
	.\ 			lambda
	let 			same as LET in Common Lisp
	quote("\'")		same as QUOTE in Common Lisp/Scheme

-Naming Regulation:
	Predicate 		end with "?" (E.g. null?)
	Destructive 		end with "!" (E.g. set!)
	Recursive Function	end with "-r" (E.g. map-r)
	Global Variable		surround by "**" (E.g. *TOP-LEVEL*)
	Function		use full spellling connected by "-" instead of abbreviation (E.g. number-of-count instead of numOfCount)
	Argument		use "lst" for list, "num" for number, "sym" for symbol
	Commentary		add commentary that shows the function's parameter and returning type (E.g. ;;Num -> Num)

-Core Data Structure:
	LoLi Object (the list structured memory):
	
	+---------------------------------------+
	|	    loliObj			|	Defined in loli_types.h
	+---------------------------------------+
	|type [enum]				|
	|value [string]				|
	|head [pointer to head(loliObj)]	|
	|tail [pointer to tail(loliObj)]	|
	|proc [pointer to procedure]		|
	|env [pointer to envrionment(loliObj)]	|
	+---------------------------------------+

	Environment (is a loliObj):
		([syma . a] ([symb . b] ([symc . c] ( ... ([symn . n] . nil)))))	Note: using [] and () just to be clear for reader, in LoLi there will only have ( and )

-Environment:
	Lookup:
		Will return a list that contains all the symbols that matches the criteria
	Insert:
		Insert the new item while adding to environment to make the environment in accending order, that makes environment easier to be looked up

-Context Based Meaning Inferring(CBMI):
	Parse the input into AST, then lookup the corresponding obj in the environment.
	
	-Key concept for the CBMI:
		Verb : Objects that takes other Objects, for example: Function (PROC) and Lambda (LAMBDA)
		Noun : Objects that only have value, for example: Symbol (SYM), Number (INT / FLT), etc.
	
	-Rules of AST:
		See the comments in the loli_ast.h
